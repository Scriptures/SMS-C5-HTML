    <h1><u>COMMITMENT TO SERVE</u></h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Commitment to serve does not arise out of nowhere. It comes from and is guided by values,
         and assumptions that spring from our <br />backgrounds, cultures, experiences and
        from our sentiment about what is right. These values shapes our vision of the world as it
        <br />should be, and motivates us to try to make it so.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Growing up from a home where financial challenges determined the future of its young
        ones was not an easy burden to live with.<br /> My mother often reminded me of how difficult it
        is for minorities like us to earn respect from society and enough money to raise <br />a family.
        She encouraged me to strive for the best by being selfish and competitive against my peers
        rather than to enjoy what I like;<br /> which was to interact with people. She always wanted me to
        become a <b>medical doctor</b> saying it is<em> a well-paying job</em>. Though that was<br /> not my career
        goal, yet I was not ready to ignore her concern since she played the role of both parents due
        to the absence of my father, <br />and her decision where not to be questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
        In secondary school, I had to battle between fulfilling the desires of my mother and my
        aspirations in life. Though the desires of <br />my family weighed more than my personal goals,
        and that I pursued a course which carries me a step closer to achieving the goals<br /> of my
        mother for me, I still believed my career goal as a <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/cs/undergraduate/software/what/#:~:text=of%20software%20applications.-,Software%20engineers%20apply%20engineering%20principles%20and%20knowledge%20of%20programming%20languages,the%20many%20career%20paths%20available." >Software Engineer</a> was already latent.
        The passion of becoming <br />who I wanted to become, conflicted with my decision and this
        carried me to a point where I needed to choose between my future <br />and my obligations as a
        son.
    </p>
    <p>
        This whole experience helped in fortifying my emotional intelligence and also improved,
        causing me to thinking beyond what is obvious<br /> and in creating suitable alternatives with
        extremely limited resources, thus, reinforcing my belief to listen to my inner voice and do<br />
        what is ethically right. It taught me to deal with emotional barriers at school and anywhere
        I found myself among people; <br />I was glad that I rose above those barriers. Also, this
        experience taught me to be logical and patient when dealing with sensitive issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In conclusion, the maturity gained from this experience has not just boosted my
        confidence, but has caused me to realise how influential<br /> personal goals are to the
        individual future. One of my personal goals is to study in a community with adequate
        academic resources, <br />leadership training, practical approach to learning, brilliant faculty
        with diverse professional background and perfect location, <br />and it is possible that Azubi Africa
        Frontend Development program has the critical tools and network needed to <br />achieve my career aspirations.
